# <a href="https://strixmusic.com/" target="_blank"><img align="left" src="www/favicon.ico" height="100" /></a> Strix Music
An open music protocol that breaks down the walls between services by defining a standardized and highly flexible API surface.

## **The Strix Music SDK**
  - Our incubation project where we define and refine the Strix protocol before going cross-language.
  - Easily bring the power of Strix to your own projects. 
  - Rapidly interface with any available music services.
  - Merge multiple music services together into a single, transparent API.
   - Bring new music services to the Strix ecosystem.

## **The Strix Music App**
  - Our incubation and demonstration MVP for the Strix SDK.
  - Multi-service, thanks to the Strix Music SDK.
  - Multi-platform, powered by the Uno Platform.
  - Multi-skinnable, thanks to the highly refined data structure in the SDK and the MVVM architecture built on top.

## **The Cores**
Cores are the music sources which power your app. The API surface is standardized, flexible and highly refined to fit the needs of many types of music sources.

Since the API surface is so standardized and flexible, the Strix Music SDK provides the option to merge multiple cores together. That means libraries, search results, recently played, devices, etc. are all seamelessly combined under a single data structure. 

Anyone can create and publish a Core, but here are some we've brought or would like to bring to the Strix ecosystem
