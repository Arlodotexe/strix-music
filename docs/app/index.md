# The Strix Music App
This app is our vision for the ultimate music app. Built on top of the Strix Music SDK, this app promises the following: 

- **Any music** - Local storage, cloud storage, streaming services, home servers - nothing is impossible.
- **Any look** - The UI can be completely swapped out with a different skin. We're building modern skins, faithful recreations of classic music apps, even novelty skins.
- **Any device** - Thanks to the Uno Platform, we can run our code on Windows, Android, iOS, Linux, MacOS and Web Browsers.
- **Offline first** - The app will stay working when the internet goes down.
- **Private by design** - No logs are generated and no servers are contacted, unless you say so.
- **Distributed and permanent** - For more advanced features, this app uses `ipfs` instead of `http`. Your devices will communicate with each other directly, without an external server.
- **Free of charge** - Distributed to users at no cost. It will never have ads, paywalls or in app purchases. We're funded by donations from our supporters and code contributions from the community.
- **Open source software** - You have the freedom to inspect, run, copy, distribute, change and improve the software as licensed.
