# Introduction to Strix Music

Strix Music provides a cohesive, flexible and standardized API that allows you to combine music sources together.

## Why?

In the past, listening to music was limited to a subset of mediums - radio, CDs, vinyl, etc. It was easy to create a music collection that you could call your own.

Now, you can listen to any song, anywhere, anytime, and the songs don't even need to be published with a record label. 

Music is scattered across the digital landscape - YouTube, Spotify, SoundCloud, audio files, Bandcamp, and _countless_ others.

Strix Music brings _all_ your music together again.
