# Introduction to Strix Music

Strix Music provides a cohesive, flexible and standardized API that allows you to combine music sources together.

## Why?

In the past, listening to music was limited to a subset of mediums - radio, CDs, vinyl, etc. It was easy to create a music collection that you could call your own.

Now, you can listen to any song, anywhere, anytime, and the songs don't even need to be published with a record label. 

Music is scattered across the digital landscape - YouTube, Spotify, SoundCloud, audio files, Bandcamp, and _countless_ others.

Strix Music brings _all_ your music together again.

# Philosophy of Strix Music
#### Our promises to the community

## A free and open standard
That means community focused and no paywalls. You'll never be charged to build with or use the Strix Music standard, Strix Music SDK or the Strix Music App. 
 
To drive our efforts, we rely on donations and contributions from users like you.

## Privacy focused
No logs are generated and no servers are contacted unless you say so. Your data is exclusively put into your hands.

## Perpetually preserved
Apps that work standalone and offline are a lost art. We want to build software where a given version will always work, whether on Day 1 or Day 10,000.

The entire project (docs, website, source code, build scripts, dependencies and releases) are perpetually preserved in every release, and hosted on [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/). If _anyone_ has these things on their local node, you'll be able to access it.

Our project will never break from a server outage, and cannot be taken down or censored.

Not even an apocalypse could ruin our hard work.
