# Release 0.1.0-app-alpha
 This release is focused around clearing tech debt. The Strix Music SDK was made to build apps on, but our top-level app architecture was made long before the SDK was ready. We wiped it and rebuilt it from the ground up, in a way that can be multi-instanced, customized, extended, and easily maintained.
